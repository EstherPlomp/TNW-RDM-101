# FAIR principles {#FAIR}

*Estimated time: 30 minutes*

In this module, we will discover the FAIR data principles and their main elements. At the end of this module, you should be able to:

-   Understand the FAIR principles and their relation to RDM
-   Identify the license that fits your research output

## What are the FAIR principles?

The FAIR principles were created in order to maximize the reuse of scientific data, to promote best practices on Research Data Management and to enable Open Science. Applying the FAIR principles means to make research data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable [@wilkinson2016].

-   Findable means that others (both human and machines) can discover the data
-   Accessible means that the data can be made available to others
-   Interoperable means that the data can be integrated with other data and can be easily used by machines or in data analysis workflows.
-   Reusable means that the data can be used for new research

These four principles should be applied (as much as possible) throughout the entire research cycle and they are closely interconnected with each other.

The FAIR Data principles are NOT:

-   A standard. The FAIR principles need to be adapted and followed as much as possible by considering the research practices in your field. FAIR principles should be rather seen as progressive steps that help you make your data re-usable.
-   Equivalent to Open Data. FAIR data does not necessarily mean openly available: it should be clear to others that the data exists and which steps they could take to potentially access the data.
-   Applied using a particular technology or tool. There might be different tools that enable FAIR data within different disciplines or research workflows.

There are important elements to consider within your research workflows if you aim to make the data of your project FAIR:

-   [Documentation & Metadata](https://youtu.be/q-NxFTlcKgs)
-   [Interoperability](https://youtu.be/83Jnyd5_vxM)
-   [Access to data](https://youtu.be/3TWye1ftR1w)
-   [Persistent identifiers](https://youtu.be/m-oWVp92xG0)
-   [Licences](https://youtu.be/3nl_Z7Jt-Z4)

## Improve the interoperability of the data using metadata standards

You can use [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/) to check if a **metadata standard** exists for your discipline or type of data.

[Examples of possible relevant metadata standards](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/data-TNW/#relevant-metadata-standards) are listed on the Open Science support website. 

## Test how aware of FAIR you are (optional)

![Use the [FAIR-Aware tool](https://fairaware.dans.knaw.nl/) to test your knowledge about the FAIR principles](https://fairaware.dans.knaw.nl/images/logos/fairaware.png){width="75%"}

## Data and Code Licences

-   To choose a licenses for data (and presentations and articles!): Use the CC [license chooser](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/).
-   To choose a license for software: Use [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/). (For more detailed information, see '[How to choose a software licence](https://softwaresaved.github.io/software-deposit-guidance/HowToChooseSoftwareLicence.html)').
-   Note that apart from CC0, the licenses for data and code are different. Software licenses are more complex as software differs from data in the ways you can reuse it, as unlike data, software is executable.
-   If in doubt, talk to Esther.
-   Indicate your license preference in [GitHub discussion #126 Licenses](https://github.com/EstherPlomp/TNW-RDM-101/discussions/126)

## FAIR software

Only read this section if you're working with code in your project, or if Research Software is one of the main outputs of your projects! 

Many of the FAIR Guiding Principles for research data can be directly applied to research software by treating software and data as similar digital research objects. However,
specific characteristics of software — such as its executability, composite nature, and continuous evolution and versioning — make it necessary to revise and extend the principles. When you need to share the code/software, you can follow the [FAIR software checklist](https://tu-delft-dcc.github.io/software/checklist.html) developed by TU Delft's Digital Competence Center.

Let’s hear from Maurits, one of TU Delft research software engineers, how the FAIR principle apply to Research Software and the distinction between FAIR software and open source:
