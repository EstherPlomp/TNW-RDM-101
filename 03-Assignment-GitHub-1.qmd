# Assignment 1 - Getting started with GitHub {#GitHub}

*Estimated time: 10-60 minutes*

Parts of the explanations below can be skipped if you already have some experience with GitHub. Go directly to ['Create an Issue'](#create-a-github-issue).

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that allows you to store and manage code. It is based on Git, which allows you to track and control changes to code. It also allows you to collaborate with others, which is our primary reason for using it during this course. You will not need to actually code to be able to use the platform!
