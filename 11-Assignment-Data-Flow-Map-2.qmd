# Assignment 3 - Data Flow Map Update {#assignment3}

*Estimated time: 60 minutes*

Now that you learned about how to make your data more FAIR, you will have another look at the [Data Flow Map assignment](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-RDM-101/06-Assignment-Data-Flow-Map-1.html) (based on [@martinez-lavanchy2022]).

### Step 1 - How to apply FAIR to your Data Flow Map {-}

-   We are providing you with new themes and some guiding text that can help you in your reflection and will allow you to structure the information.
    -   Dowload this week's template from the data repository:
        -   Go to <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6325938>
        -   Download the 4th file: RDM101_Assignment2_Week2_DataFlowMap_Template.pptx
-   You can duplicate slides if you have more than three datasets.
-   Copy the datasets to the new template
    -   Remember to take into consideration the flags (relevant attributes) you have added to the different data types, which can determine the way you handle each of the themes.

### Step 2 - Reflect on the theme [Data organisation](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-RDM-101/08-Realising-FAIR-Organisation.html) {-}

Reflect and answer this as one theme for all the datasets:

1.  What folder structure will you use for your project? (and how does the data fit in there)
2.  What naming convention are you going to use? (show us an example based on your expected dataset)
    -   You can select one convention to use across all datasets or you can define different ones for each dataset.
    -   Remember that once you choose a convention you need to be consistent.
3.  Additional remarks

A file name that shows 'New_Final_final_new-23_fuckingfinal. jpeg'. For each component a box with explanation is added. For the first final the description 'the finished file' is added. For the second final the box says 'the finished file wihtout spelling mistakes. For New-final-final the box says 'the finished file after the client made a last minute complete change of direction. For the added new the box says 'the finished file after everyone in the pointless meeting managed to add in their own change. The 23 box says 'the finished file after was presumably 23 emails'. For fucking final the box says 'the finished version at the point that you stopped caring'"}

### Step 3 - Reflect on the theme [Metadata and Documentation](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-RDM-101/09-Realising-FAIR-Documentation.html) {-}

Reflect and answer these questions for each dataset:

1.  What type of documentation do you need to generate/write? (metadata, data collection process, data dictionary, code versioning, etc.)
2.  Will you use a metadata standard to document your data?
    -   You can use [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/) to check if a metadata standard exists for your discipline or type of data. If one exists, you can provide the name and the link on FAIRsharing to it.
3.  What tools are helpful to generate/write the documentation needed?
4.  Additional remarks

### Step 4 - Reflect on the theme File formats {-}

Remember that **file formats** can enable or not interoperability and reusability. You already provided the data format in which you will collect/create the different datasets in your project (assignment 2). Go back to that information and think if you can convert those formats to an open file format that would increase interoperability if somebody would like to reuse the data.

Reflect and answer these questions for each dataset:

1.  Are your files in an open file format? Or, is the code in an open programming language?
2.  Can you convert the proprietary file formats to an open file format? If yes, to which open file format?
3.  If the data/code is in a proprietary format, what information/software would others need to re-use the data/code?

### Step 6 - Reflect on the theme [Access and Publication](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-RDM-101/10-Realising-FAIR-Publication.html) {-}

It is important to reflect early in your project about who will be accessing the datasets you collect/create, when they will access the data in the different steps of the project and how. Also, before preparing your data for publication, you need to reflect if it is possible/allowed for you to publish the data. You might need to process some data before you can make them available, especially if you are working with confidential data.

Reflect and answer these questions for each dataset:

1.  Who will have access to this dataset during the project?
2.  If others than you will have access to the dataset during the project, how will you share the data?
3.  At the end of the project this dataset can be:
    a.  **open** - no confidential information in it , it can be published
        -   In which repository will you publish it?
        -   Does the repository provide a DOI and license for the dataset?
        -   What [license](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-RDM-101/07-FAIR-principles.html#data-and-code-licences) do you plan to use?
    b.  **restricted access** - there is confidential information in it, can't be anonymize, can't be published
        -   How can somebody request the data after you finish your project?
    c.  **restricted access with public metadata** - there is confidential information in it, but the description of the dataset can be published
        -   Where will you publish the metadata and where will the data be stored?
        -   Does the repository provide a DOI and license for the metadata?
        -   What [license](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-RDM-101/07-FAIR-principles.html#data-and-code-licences) do you plan to use?
4.  Go to the toolbox and use the action arrows to indicate if you need to process the data before publishing them.

### Step 5 - Share your updated assignment via your GitHub Issue {-}

To share your assignment you will need to either upload your assignment somewhere and provide a link, or use links you can set up via SURFdrive or OneDrive. 

-   **SURFdrive**: When the Desktop app is active, you can right-click files, select SURFdrive, and select 'create and copy a public link. See [Sharing using SURFdrive](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/data-sharing-SURFdrive/) for more details.
-   **OneDrive**: Right-click the file or folder in your OneDrive folder on your computer and select Share a OneDrive link.
