# Plan for RDM {#plan}

*Estimated time: 120 minutes (includes assignment 4)*

We will take a closer look at planning for RDM. In relation to this, data management plans and the tool DMPonline will be further explained. At the end of this module you should be able to:

-   Recognise the relevance of planning research data management
-   Get familiar with the concept of Data Management Plans and their format
-   Create a data management plan using the appropriate tool
-   Recognise the value of creating a Data Management Plan

## Activities

-   Watch the animation video to learn what a data management plan (DMP) is
-   Watch the videos of a TU Delft researcher and a Faculty data steward to learn why they think it is relevant to prepare a DMP
-   Create a DMP using [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/)

## Software Management Plans (optional)

If you are working with computer code or developing software within your PhD project, merely sharing the code/software is insufficient to guarantee the reproducibility of research. You will need to think about the ways of sharing the code/software underpinning your research in a proper manner. A Software Management Plan helps to implement best practices during software development and ensures that software is accessible and reusable in the short and longer term. It also contributes to the reproducibility of results and stimulates collaborative work on open-source software for research.

Have a look at the [Practical guide to Software Management Plans](https://zenodo.org/record/7248877) to get started with a Software Management Plan!
