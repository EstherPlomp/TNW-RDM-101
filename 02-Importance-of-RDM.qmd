# The importance of RDM {#importance}

*Estimated time: 70 minutes*

During this module we will share different perspectives and let you discuss with each other about the importance of RDM in ensuring research reproducibility. At the end of this module you should be able to:

-   Recognize the importance of research data management
-   Explain why RDM is relevant for reproducibility and re-use of data

## Why care about RDM?

Why should you be aware of your Research Data Management?

-   [01-1_Module-1_Video_Presentation_Why RDM is relevant for you](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJ8R7DbiPRq2ynaImHGzdz8QBgwVt82o/view) (*8 minutes*)

Reflect about what you heard on the video and bring your thoughts and your horror stories to **class 1**. 

You can also listen to the [Data Horror Song](https://twitter.com/rafamoral/status/1571622591219236864) or the [Zheng Lab - Bad Project video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl4L4M8m4d0) for some inspiration!
