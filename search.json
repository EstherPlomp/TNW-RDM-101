Learners will be able to integrate good data management practices within their workflows from the beginning of their projects. The application of this knowledge to their research will allow them to reflect on how to work efficiently and in a reproducible manner with their research data, while complying with funders and institutional requirements.\nPlease note that some of the course structure has been adjusted. The original course makes use of the BrightSpace platform which also allows for integration of quizzes. Here, GitHub will be used for any discussions. Additionally, the original course is fully virtual. The classes of this course will take place in person.\nThis is a three weeks blended course, meaning that is a mix of self-studying and two in-person class meetings.\n\nThe time to be spent for the course is approximately 16 hours in total, which is equivalent to 1.5 GS credits in the category of Research skills of the GS Education Programme, if the requirements are fulfilled.\nThe online learning environment is this website and it’s GitHub Repository. Participants will have to set up a GitHub account to participate and will be instructed on how GitHub works.\n\n\n\nAll the course materials can be found here: Martinez-Lavanchy, P.M., van Schöll, Pim, & Zormpa, Eirini.

Depending on the discipline you work in, research data can be collected or produced in different ways.

Research Data can be digital such as tabular data, videos, algorithms, scripts, transcripts, and codebooks. They can also be non-digital, for example, laboratory samples, sketchbooks, and prototypes.\nWe talked to some TU Delft researchers working in different disciplines and we asked them: ‘What is the research data you work with?’ Let’s see what they shared with us:\n\nSian Jones – Faculty Of Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG)\nWirawan Agahari – TU Delft Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management (TPM)"

It is very important for TU Delft that researchers follow best practices on Research Data Management (RDM). That is why since 2018 TU Delft has published a set of policies which provide a clear division of roles and responsibilities around RDM.\n\nResearch Data framework policy\n\nThis Framework policy is accompanied by Faculty-specific data management policies, which provide more detailed requirements and guidelines for the disciplines associated with each Faculty.\n\nFaculty Research Data Management Policies or direct download of the TNW/AS policy.\n\nSoftware is recognised at TU Delft as a valuable research output that needs to be well documented, preserved and, whenever possible, consistent with the FAIR principles. The TU Delft Research Software Policy provides a clear division of roles and responsibilities and sets out a simplified, streamlined process to help researchers share software.\n\nTUD Research Software Policy\n\n\n6.9.1 Policy summary\nThis section summarises your responsibilities as a TU Delft/Applied Sciences PhD candidate:\n\nDeveloping a written data management plan (DMP) for managing research outputs within the first 12 months of the PhD study. (As part of the Go/No-Go meeting. For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2020 onwards.)\nAttending the relevant training in data management, for which credits can be obtained through the Graduate School.\nEnsuring that all data and code underlying completed PhD theses are appropriately documented and accessible for at least 10 years from the end of the research project, in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), unless there are valid reasons which make research data unsuitable for sharing. (For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2019 onwards.)\n\nWhen sharing software:\n\nUse a data repository to obtain a DOI for the software. If you use 4TU.ResearchData your software will be automatically registered. If you use other repositories, such as Zenodo, you will have the register the software via PURE\nChoose one of the pre-approved licenses: MIT, BSD, Apache, GPL, AGPL, LGPL, EUPL, CC0.\n\nSee this slide for more details on how to share your software."

Good data documentation starts with good organisation and file naming of the data of your project! Good data organisation on your computer or your Project Data (U:) drive will allow you to make the data Findable both for yourself and for your collaborators who have access to the data. Making the data findable also indirectly improves the re-usability of the data. You need to be able to find the data before you can re-use it! Implementing a good folder structure, data organisation and a meaningful file naming convention is a simple first step towards making data FAIR.\nIn the next video, we will go through some best practices to help you organise the data of your project efficiently. These best practices are using a good folder structure, tagging files (if possible) and an appropriate file naming convention to enhance the findability of the data in your directories.\n\n04-1_Module-4_Video_Presentation_Data organisation (15 minutes, audio will play automatically in full presentation modus)\n\n\n9.2.1 Presentation Resources\n\nFolder structure explanation of Neuroscientist Nikola Vukovic\nThe Turing Way - Data storage and organisation The Turing Way Community (2021).\nTagging and Finding Your Files: Home.
