    "text": "1 Welcome!\nThis website is an adaptation of the Research Data Management 101 Course provided by TU Delft Library.\nThis course provides PhD candidates with the essential knowledge and the core skills to manage research data according to best practice. Learners will be able to integrate good data management practices within their workflows from the beginning of their projects. The application of this knowledge to their research will allow them to reflect on how to work efficiently and in a reproducible manner with their research data, while complying with funders and institutional requirements.\nPlease note that some of the course structure has been adjusted. The original course makes use of the BrightSpace platform which also allows for integration of quizzes. Here, GitHub will be used for any discussions.\nThis is a four-five weeks blended course, meaning that is a mix of self-studying and two in-person class meetings.",

You can capture them in real-time (sensors, images), you can collect them using laboratory instruments and they can derive from interviews or numerical simulations, among others. Research Data can be digital such as tabular data, videos, algorithms, scripts, transcripts, and codebooks. They can also be non-digital, for example, laboratory samples, sketchbooks, and prototypes.\nIn the next two videos, researchers from TU Delft tell us about the confidential data they work with and what RDM best-practice they follow:\nData can be classified in various ways, which is important for effective data management.

It involves collecting data through structured methods, such as surveys or experiments, and is analysed using statistical techniques.\nQualitative data is descriptive in nature, focusing on non-numerical information such as opinions, experiences, or behaviours. Qualitative data is typically collected through methods like interviews, observations, or open-ended survey questions and is analysed through thematic analysis or interpretation.\n\n\n6.1.2 Research Data categorised by collection method\nExperimental data: Data collected through controlled experiments where variables are intentionally manipulated and measured to establish cause-and-effect relationships.\nComputational data: Data generated or processed using computational methods, such as simulations, numerical calculations, or machine learning outputs.\nObservational data: Data obtained through direct observations of real-world phenomena, documenting existing behaviours, events, or characteristics without manipulation.\nDerived/processed data: Data obtained by analysing or processing raw data. It is generated through calculations, algorithms, or transformations applied to the original data.\nResearch software/code: Computer programs or code developed and utilised in research activities to support data collection, analysis, modelling, or visualisation.\n\n\n6.1.3 Research Data categorised by recording medium\nDigital data including tabular data, images, videos, algorithms, scripts, transcripts, codebooks,\nNon-digital data including laboratory samples, sketchbooks, prototypes.\n\n\n6.1.4 Research Data categorised by file format\nResearch data can also be encountered in diverse formats during the data acquisition process reflecting the specific needs and characteristics of each scientific domain. The ability to access and reuse your data in the future depends on the chosen format. If the associated software/hardware is no longer used, data may become inaccessible.

It is very important for TU Delft that researchers follow best practices on Research Data Management (RDM). That is why since 2018 TU Delft has published a set of policies which provide a clear division of roles and responsibilities around RDM.\n\nResearch Data framework policy\n\nThis Framework policy is accompanied by Faculty-specific data management policies, which provide more detailed requirements and guidelines for the disciplines associated with each Faculty.\n\nFaculty Research Data Management Policies or direct download of the TNW/AS policy.\n\nAt TU Delft, software is recognised as a valuable research output that needs to be well documented, preserved and, whenever possible, consistent with the FAIR principles. The TU Delft Research Software Policy provides a clear division of roles and responsibilities and sets out a simplified, streamlined process to help researchers share software.\n\nTUD Research Software Policy\n\n\n6.6.1 Policy summary\nThis section summarises your responsibilities as a TU Delft/Applied Sciences PhD candidate:\n\nDeveloping a written data management plan (DMP) for managing research outputs within the first 12 months of the PhD study. (As part of the Go/No-Go meeting. For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2020 onwards.)\nAttending the relevant training in data management, for which credits can be obtained through the Graduate School.\nEnsuring that all data and code underlying completed PhD theses are appropriately documented and accessible for at least 10 years from the end of the research project, in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), unless there are valid reasons which make research data unsuitable for sharing. (For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2019 onwards.)\n\nWhen sharing software:\n\nUse a data repository to obtain a DOI for the software. If you use 4TU.ResearchData your software will be automatically registered. If you use other repositories, such as Zenodo, you will have the register the software via PURE\nChoose one of the pre-approved licenses: MIT, BSD, Apache, GPL, AGPL, LGPL, EUPL, CC0.\n\nSee this slide for more details on how to share your software.",

Good data organisation on your computer or your Project Data (U:) drive will allow you to make the data Findable both for yourself and for your collaborators who have access to the data. Making the data findable also indirectly improves the re-usability of the data. You need to be able to find the data before you can re-use it! Implementing a good folder structure, data organisation and a meaningful file naming convention are first steps towards making data FAIR.\nIn the next video, we will go through some best practices to help you organise the data of your project efficiently. These best practices are using a good folder structure, tagging files (if possible) and an appropriate file naming convention to enhance the findability of the data in your directories.",

    "text": "11.1 Data access\nIt is important to reflect about data access at the beginning of your project to ensure that the right people have access to the right data.\nOne way to make the data of your project Findable and Accessible to a broad audience is to publish it in a data repository. Data repositories help you comply with the FAIR principles and make it easy to apply some of their main elements, such as licences and persistent identifiers.\nIn the next video we will delve into data access during and after a research project. You will also be introduced to the topic of data publication and data repositories.\nTU Delft researchers can always use the 4TU.ResearchData repository (free up to 1 TB per researcher per year)\nIf you would like to look for a disciplinary specific data repository, you can use:\nData repositories will facilitate sustainable access to your data.

    "text": "11.3 Software Sharing\nOnly read this section if you’re working with code in your project, or if Research Software is one of the main outputs of your projects!\nBefore you get started with writing your code, you might want to look for code and software that others have already written and shared. This could be work by a predecessor in your team, a code snippet you found online, or software that is published and archived. When reusing research software, there are some relevant factors to consider, such as, where to find and how to evaluate the reusability of the available software? Maurits walks you through those considerations in the following video:\nFinding and reusing code Video citation: Finding and reusing code. Video recording from TU Delft MOOC Open Science: Sharing Your Research with the World. Presenter: Dr. Maurits Kok. Credits: TU Delft Extension School, TU Delft New Media Center, TU Delft Digital Competence Center. Licence: CC-BY-NC-SA]\nOnce you get started writing your code or developing your software, other best practices and management tools will be needed. If you have collected code snippets from different sources, debugging the code might be challenging, and as the development process goes along, you might want to compare current versions to earlier versions.\nThe same as with research data, you should always think ‘who might be reusing your code?’ At the very least, it is your past, present and future selves. Therefore, implementing best practices to make your software FAIR and reproducible since the beginning of the project is very relevant! In the next video, Maurits will provide an overview of good practices for developing reproducible and reusable code:\nDeveloping research software Video citation: Developing research software. Video recording from TU Delft MOOC Open Science: Sharing Your Research with the World. Presenter: Dr. Maurits Kok. Credits: TU Delft Extension School, TU Delft New Media Center, TU Delft Digital Competence Center. Licence: CC-BY-NC-SA\nOnce you are ready to publish your research work, the data and the code also needs to be published as you have already learned in the ‘Data Access and Data Publication’ video. If you need some extra encouragement to publish your research software or piece of code, in the following video Maurits will tell you why you should publish your code as open source and how to do so following the FAIR principles for research software:\nPublishing Research Software Video citation: Publishing Research Software.

Licence: CC-BY-NC-SA\nHelpful resources:\n\nFAIR software checklist prepared by the TU Delft Digital Competence Center\nSoftware Carpentry lessons\nCodeRefinery lessons\n\nJust sharing software via platforms like GitHub is not sufficient to adhere to the FAIR principles. GitHub/GitLab does not assign a persistent identifier/DOI to the software, and GitHub/GitLab does not have a long term preservation policy like data repositories do. You can share your software on GitHub/GitLab and share a snapshot/version of the code in a data repository as well.\n\nSee here for more information between the GitHub/Zenodo integration\nSee here for more information on how to do this using 4TU.ResearchData\n\nCheckout papers with code to see how other researchers have shared their code!",
