    "text": "1 Welcome!\nThis website is an adaptation of the Research Data Management 101 Course provided by TU Delft Library.\nThis course provides PhD candidates with the essential knowledge and the core skills to manage research data according to best practice. Learners will be able to integrate good data management practices within their workflows from the beginning of their projects. The application of this knowledge to their research will allow them to reflect on how to work efficiently and in a reproducible manner with their research data, while complying with funders and institutional requirements.\nPlease note that some of the course structure has been adjusted. The original course makes use of the BrightSpace platform which also allows for integration of quizzes. Here, GitHub will be used for any discussions. Additionally, the original course is fully virtual. The classes of this course will take place in person.\nThis is a four weeks blended course, meaning that is a mix of self-studying and two in-person class meetings."

It is very important for TU Delft that researchers follow best practices on Research Data Management (RDM). That is why since 2018 TU Delft has published a set of policies which provide a clear division of roles and responsibilities around RDM.\n\nResearch Data framework policy\n\nThis Framework policy is accompanied by Faculty-specific data management policies, which provide more detailed requirements and guidelines for the disciplines associated with each Faculty.\n\nFaculty Research Data Management Policies or direct download of the TNW/AS policy.\n\nSoftware is recognised at TU Delft as a valuable research output that needs to be well documented, preserved and, whenever possible, consistent with the FAIR principles. The TU Delft Research Software Policy provides a clear division of roles and responsibilities and sets out a simplified, streamlined process to help researchers share software.\n\nTUD Research Software Policy\n\n\n6.7.1 Policy summary\nThis section summarises your responsibilities as a TU Delft/Applied Sciences PhD candidate:\n\nDeveloping a written data management plan (DMP) for managing research outputs within the first 12 months of the PhD study. (As part of the Go/No-Go meeting. For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2020 onwards.)\nAttending the relevant training in data management, for which credits can be obtained through the Graduate School.\nEnsuring that all data and code underlying completed PhD theses are appropriately documented and accessible for at least 10 years from the end of the research project, in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), unless there are valid reasons which make research data unsuitable for sharing. (For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2019 onwards.)\n\nWhen sharing software:\n\nUse a data repository to obtain a DOI for the software. If you use 4TU.ResearchData your software will be automatically registered. If you use other repositories, such as Zenodo, you will have the register the software via PURE\nChoose one of the pre-approved licenses: MIT, BSD, Apache, GPL, AGPL, LGPL, EUPL, CC0.\n\nSee this slide for more details on how to share your software."

The FAIR principles need to be adapted and followed as much as possible by considering the research practices in your field. FAIR principles should be rather seen as progressive steps that help you make your data re-usable.\nEquivalent to Open Data. FAIR data does not necessarily mean openly available: it should be clear to others that the data exists and which steps they could take to potentially access the data.\nApplied using a particular technology or tool.

    "text": "9.1 Data Organisation\nIn the previous module you learned that ‘Documentation’ is one of the main elements of the FAIR principles. Good data documentation starts with good organisation and file naming of the data of your project! Good data organisation on your computer or your Project Data (U:) drive will allow you to make the data Findable both for yourself and for your collaborators who have access to the data. Making the data findable also indirectly improves the re-usability of the data. You need to be able to find the data before you can re-use it! Implementing a good folder structure, data organisation and a meaningful file naming convention is a simple first step towards making data FAIR.\nIn the next video, we will go through some best practices to help you organise the data of your project efficiently. These best practices are using a good folder structure, tagging files (if possible) and an appropriate file naming convention to enhance the findability of the data in your directories.\n\n04-1_Module-4_Video_Presentation_Data organisation(15 minutes)\nThe Turing Way information on File Naming Conventions\n\n\n\n\nImage by Allison Horst\n\n\n\n9.1.1 Presentation Resources\n\nFolder structure explanation of Neuroscientist Nikola Vukovic\nThe Turing Way - Data storage and organisation (Community 2022)\nTagging and Finding Your Files: Home.

Cookiecutter is especially helpful to people who program/Python-users or if you have to set up a lot of folder structures for smaller projects (for example, with students).\nNote that you need to have Python and pip (or Anaconda) installed to easily follow the video. To install Anaconda:\n\nWindows (instruction video)\n\nOpen https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section with your web browser.\nDownload the Anaconda for Windows installer with Python 3. (If you are not sure which version to choose, you probably want the 64-bit Graphical Installer Anaconda3-…-Windows-x86_64.exe)\nInstall Python 3 by running the Anaconda Installer, using all of the defaults for installation except make sure to check Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable.\n\nLinux\n\nOpen https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section with your web browser.\nDownload the Anaconda Installer with Python 3 for Linux.\nOpen a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the executable is downloaded (e.g., cd ~/Downloads).\nType 'bash Anaconda3- and then press Tab to autocomplete the full file name. The name of file you just downloaded should appear.\nPress Enter (or Return depending on your keyboard). You will follow the text-only prompts. To move through the text, press Spacebar.\nType Yes and press Enter to approve the license.\nPress Enter to approve the default location for the files.\nType Yes and press Enter to prepend Anaconda to your PATH (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).\nClose the terminal window.\n\nMac (instruction video)\n\nOpen https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section with your web browser.\nDownload the Anaconda Installer with Python 3 for macOS (you can either use the Graphical or the Command Line Installer).\nInstall Python 3 by running the Anaconda Installer using all of the defaults for installation.\n\n\n\nWatch the video on setting up a research compendium using Cookiecutter (3:36 min).\nSee the instructions on how to clone the Cookiecutter template\na. Information about hidden folders on Windows\n\n\nYou can also find a visualisation of the template on the GitHub repository\n\nWork on your own to populate the template with information/files from your project.\nShare your folder structure on GitHub discussion #36 Folder Structure and comment on another person’s folder structure\nDiscuss with your peers how similar your own folder structure is to the one you created using Cookiecutter. What additional elements are there in the Cookiecutter project? Is there anything that the Cookiecutter template is missing?\n\nIf you didn’t find this template useful, you can browse these templates to see if one of these fits your needs better:\n\nData Science\nPython template\nReproducible Science\nMore templates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems with Cookiecutter?\n\n\n\nYou can also download the template from GitHub. Note that if you’d like to reuse this template a lot, it will be easier to do it as described above.\n\nGo to “https://github.com/bvreede/good-enough-project”\nGo to Code -&gt; Download ZIP\nExtract all files in the folder where you’d like to save it, and rename the folder {{cookiecutter.project_slug}} to the name of your project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing your folder structure\n\n\n\nYou can use the tree command to generate a list of your folder structure and its files.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by ErrantScience"
