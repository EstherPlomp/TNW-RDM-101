The application of this knowledge to their research will allow them to reflect on how to work efficiently and in a reproducible manner with their research data, while complying with funders and institutional requirements.\nThis is a three weeks blended course, meaning that is a mix of self-studying and two in-person class meetings. * The time to be spent for the course is approximately 16 hours in total, which is equivalent to 1.5 GS credits in the category of Research skills of the GS Education Programme, if the requirements are fulfilled. * The online learning environment is this website and it’s GitHub Repository.

Depending on the discipline you work in, research data can be collected or produced in different ways. You can capture them in real-time (e.g. sensors, images), you can collect them using laboratory instruments and they can derive from interviews or numerical simulations, among others. Research Data can be digital such as tabular data, videos, algorithms, scripts, transcripts, and codebooks. They can also be non-digital, for example, laboratory samples, sketchbooks, and prototypes.\nWe talked to some TU Delft researchers working in different disciplines and we asked them: ‘What is the research data you work with?’ Let’s see what they shared with us:\n\nSian Jones – Faculty Of Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG)\nWirawan Agahari – TU Delft Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management (TPM)"

Following good data storage practices protect you from data loss and facilitate effective collaborations. In this video, we will go through the infrastructure provided centrally at TU Delft for storing, backup and sharing Research Data.

That is why since 2018 TU Delft has published a set of policies which provide a clear division of roles and responsibilities around RDM.\n\nResearch Data framework policy\n\nThis Framework policy is accompanied by Faculty-specific data management policies, which provide more detailed requirements and guidelines for the disciplines associated with each Faculty.\n\nFaculty Research Data Management Policies or direct download of the TNW/AS policy.\n\nSoftware is recognised at TU Delft as a valuable research output that needs to be well documented, preserved and, whenever possible, consistent with the FAIR principles. The TUD Research Software Policy provides a clear division of roles and responsibilities and sets out a simplified, streamlined process to help researchers share software. * TUD Research Software Policy\n\n5.7.1 Policy summary\nThis section summarises your responsibilities as a TU Delft/Applied Sciences PhD candidate:\n\nDeveloping a written data management plan (DMP) for managing research outputs within the first 12 months of the PhD study. (As part of the Go/No-Go meeting. For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2020 onwards.)\nAttending the relevant training in data management, for which credits can be obtained through the Graduate School.\nEnsuring that all data and code underlying completed PhD theses are appropriately documented and accessible for at least 10 years from the end of the research project, in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), unless there are valid reasons which make research data unsuitable for sharing. (For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2019 onwards.)\n\nWhen sharing software: * Use a data repository to obtain a DOI for the software. If you use 4TU.ResearchData your software will be automatically registered. If you use other repositories, such as Zenodo, you will have the register the software via PURE * Choose one of the pre-approved licenses: MIT, BSD, Apache, GPL, AGPL, LGPL, EUPL, CC0.\nSee this slide for more details on how to share your software."

Good data documentation starts with good organisation and file naming of the data of your project! Good data organisation on your computer or your Project Data (U:) drive will allow you to make the data Findable both for yourself and for your collaborators who have access to the data. Making the data findable also indirectly improves the re-usability of the data. You need to be able to find the data before you can re-use it! Implementing a good folder structure, data organisation and a meaningful file naming convention is a simple first step towards making data FAIR.\nIn the next video, we will go through some best practices to help you organise the data of your project efficiently.

Documentation is vital to making your work understandable, which is, in turn, necessary for your work to be reusable. Documentation is important not only for data, but for your projects in general, including the code you write. Your documentation should provide context for your project and its data and should, for example, provide information about the data collection, structure, and ownership.\nIn the next video we will talk about different methods and tools you can use to document projects, datasets, and code. We will also briefly talk about metadata. 04-2_Module-4_Video_Presentation_DataDocumentation]\n## Assignment: Create a ReadMe file Estimated time: 15 minutes\n\nDownload the Cornell template for a ReadMe file.\nAdapt and start filling in the template to describe a dataset of your project (you are allowed to delete and add new fields)\nIf you are unsure about the meaning of a component of the ReadMe file, go to: Guide to writing “ReadMe” style metadata - Cornell University\nWhen you’re finished, share your template on GitHub.\nPick a ReadMe file of someone else and read it.

Their resources are extremely comprehensive and they have a fantastic Intro R course, especially for those who will be using R for doing statistics.\nRight now, we REALLY like this short intro course by @juliesquid & @allisonhorst. They teach a lot of the workflow and tools around using R right from the get go, which we think is more helpful than knowing how to do all the things. The (excellent) materials are thoughtfully put together, link to a ton of other great resources, and just like the online #rstats community in general, are super supportive of new learners.\nWe also really like: * Teacup Giraffes R and statistics materials from Desirée De Leon and Hasse Walum.\n* Data Science in a Box course by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and * Adventures in R by Kelly Bodwin.\nIf you want a book to work from/through, R for Data Science is highly recommended. (book is free online)\nThe R Studio Education team have assembled a phenomenal array of courses, tutorials, and other materials for learning R, and for many types of data analyses and modeling using R. These are top notch and so thoughtfully put together. There is something for learners at all levels.\nA plug for the online R community. Follow the hashtag #rstats, & also check out accounts @RLadiesGlobal & @R4dsCommunity. The weekly #TidyTuesday social coding project is also a great way to practice your growing R skills. Have fun!\nThe R4dsCommunity Slack is a briliant resource for getting help to your R questions and finding tutorials. They also hold online Office Hours where you can get help with R from a real human.\nThe RStudio Community is a great go-to.\nLearn R from within R with interactive sessions using swirlstats.com.\nThe carpentries R lessons are also a fab resource."
