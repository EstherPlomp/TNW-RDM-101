## Research Data definition

Research data is any information that has been collected, observed, generated or created to validate research findings. Depending on the discipline you work in, research data can be collected or produced in different ways. You can capture them in real-time (e.g. sensors, images), you can collect them using laboratory instruments and they can derive from interviews or numerical simulations, among others. Research Data can be digital such as tabular data, videos, algorithms, scripts, transcripts, and codebooks. They can also be non-digital, for example, laboratory samples, sketchbooks, and prototypes.

We talked to some TU Delft researchers working in different disciplines and we asked them: 'What is the research data you work with?' Let's see what they shared with us:

-   [Wirawan Agahari -- TU Delft Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management (TPM)](https://youtu.be/sGtoAd8EZl8)

## Confidential data

There are multiple types of confidential data that you might be working with during your research project. Some examples include:

-   personal data (information about an identified or identifiable natural person)
-   national security data (such as nuclear research)
-   data falling under export control regulations
-   confidential data received from commercial, or other external partners
-   data related to competitive advantage (for example, patent, IP)
-   data which could lead to reputation/brand damage (e.g. climate change, personal information, animal research)
-   politically-sensitive data (such as research commissioned by public authorities, research on societal issues)

When working with confidential data, you need additional security measures for your data to make sure that they are not accidentally released.

In the next two videos, researchers from TU Delft tell us about the confidential data they work with and what RDM best-practice they follow:

-   [Sian Jones talking about collaboration with industry](https://youtu.be/5MbwTjgc8Vk)
-   [Wirawan Agahari talking about personal data in his research](https://youtu.be/YCXZce3qGXI)

## Personal Data

Only read these materials if you work with personal data (data that can identify a person)

-   [TU Delft Information about privacy](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/privacy-security/privacy/)
-   If you conduct research which involves human Research Subjects (ie: where human participants are the source your research data), you will have to submit an application for approval to the [TU Delft Human Research Ethic Committee](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/strategy/integrity-policy/human-research-ethics).
-   [Personal data management - The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-personal.html)

## Relevant RDM steps within a research project

In the following presentation you can go through a simplified cycle which can represent your project. Have a look at the RDM questions you might ask at each step of research.

## Discussion

For this module's discussion, please answer the following question:

-   What is your main challenge regarding your data management?

Post your answers in [GitHub Discussion #7](https://github.com/EstherPlomp/TNW-RDM-101/issues/2#issue-1333675920https://github.com/EstherPlomp/TNW-RDM-101/discussions/7).

Please read your peers' responses and reply to any you find interesting!

## Research Data infrastructure at TU Delft

In the next video we will go through the infrastructure provided centrally at TU Delft for storing, backup and sharing Research Data. Before starting the data collection/creation within your project, it is good to reflect where you will store and how you will back up the data. Selecting a storage and backup strategy will mean that data is safe during your research project, including in the case of unpredicted problems. Following good data storage practices protect you from data loss and facilitate effective collaborations. In this video, we will go through the infrastructure provided centrally at TU Delft for storing, backup and sharing Research Data. You should ask your supervisor if within your research group/department/ project there is a preferred approach for data storage and backup, or if there are customised solutions already in place.

## RDM responsibilities

In this section we would like to make you aware of the responsibilities of TU Delft PhD candidates regarding Research Data Management.

These responsibilities are detailed in the University and Faculty Policies. It is very important for TU Delft that researchers follow best practices on Research Data Management (RDM). That is why since 2018 **TU Delft** has published a set of policies which provide a clear division of roles and responsibilities around RDM.

-   [Research Data framework policy](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4088123)

This Framework policy is accompanied by **Faculty-specific data management policies**, which provide more detailed requirements and guidelines for the disciplines associated with each Faculty.

-   [Faculty Research Data Management Policies](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/policies/tu-delft-faculty-policies) or [direct download of the TNW/AS policy](https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/Beleid/2020_AS_Research_Data_Management_Policy.pdf).

Software is recognised at TU Delft as a valuable research output that needs to be well documented, preserved and, whenever possible, consistent with the [FAIR principles](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-RDM-101/07-FAIR-principles.html). The **TU Delft Research Software Policy** provides a clear division of roles and responsibilities and sets out a simplified, streamlined process to help researchers share software.

-   [TUD Research Software Policy](https://zenodo.org/record/4629662)

### Policy summary

This section summarises your responsibilities as a TU Delft/Applied Sciences PhD candidate:

-   Developing a written data management plan (DMP) for managing research outputs within the first 12 months of the PhD study. (As part of the Go/No-Go meeting. For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2020 onwards.)
-   Attending the relevant training in data management, for which credits can be obtained through the Graduate School.
-   Ensuring that all data and code underlying completed PhD theses are appropriately documented and accessible for at least 10 years from the end of the research project, in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), unless there are [valid reasons](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/buttons/faqs#c547686) which make research data unsuitable for sharing. (For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2019 onwards.)

When sharing software:

-   Use a data repository to obtain a DOI for the software. If you use [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info//en/) your software will be automatically registered. If you use other repositories, such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), you will have the register the software via PURE
-   Choose one of the pre-approved licenses: MIT, BSD, Apache, GPL, AGPL, LGPL, EUPL, CC0.

See [this slide](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/4UtGIygt9940Cog) for more details on how to share your software.
