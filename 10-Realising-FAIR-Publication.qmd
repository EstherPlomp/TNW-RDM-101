# Realising FAIR: Data Publication {#realisingFAIR3}

*Estimated time: 15 minutes*

In this module, we will focus on the realisation of FAIR data. We will explore some best practices and tools that can facilitate the implementation of the FAIR principles. At the end of this module you should be able to:

-   Identify relevant tools to advance towards FAIR data
-   Discuss data publication, best practices and restrictions

## Data access

It is important to reflect about data access at the beginning of your project to ensure that the right people have access to the right data.

One way to make the data of your project Findable and Accessible to a broad audience is to publish it in a **data repository**. Data repositories help you comply with the FAIR principles and make it easy to apply some of their main elements, such as **licences** and **persistent identifiers**.

In the next video we will delve into data access during and after a research project. You will also be introduced to the topic of data publication and data repositories.

TU Delft researchers can always use the [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info//en/) repository (free up to 1 TB per researcher per year)

-   For more information, see the [How to videos on the 4TU.ResearchData YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn5humJTp8aeCwRCOr8ec4w)

If you would like to look for a disciplinary specific data repository, you can use:

-   [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/)
-   [fairsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/)

Data repositories will facilitate sustainable access to your data. For more information, watch this short video on '[Sustainability of data use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhI1SF_r_K8)' (from the Open Data Governance and Use - released under the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license)

## Data/Software Articles

You can also share your data and code via a **data or software article**.

-   [List of data journals](https://openworking.wordpress.com/2022/02/17/publishing-a-data-article/) with TU Delft resources indicated
-   [In which journal should I publish my software?](https://www.software.ac.uk/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software)
    -   for example: the [Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.theoj.org/)

## Why not the supplemental materials?

-   Check [this slide](https://estherplomp.github.io/PRES-data-software/#27) on some downsides of sharing your data/code in supplemental materials

## Assessing FAIR datasets

Choose one of the datasets below and assess whether they are following the FAIR principles: 

- **Findable**
    - From the title to the dataset was it an easy way?
    - Does the dataset have a DOI to make it more Findable?
    - Does it have enough metadata to easily find it?
- **Accessible**
    - Is it clear for you if the data is accessible for re-use? 
    - Are you able to download the data for your own use? 
- **Interoperable**
    - Is the dataset in a file format that you can easily re-use?
- **Re-usable**
    - If you come across this dataset, how likely is it that you can easily use it? 
    - Does the dataset have enough documentation for you to understand the context of the data? 
    - Does it have a clear usage licence? Which one?
