# Assignment 2 - Data Flow Map {#assignment2}

*Estimated time: 60 minutes*

In this assignment [based on @martinez-lavanchy2022] you will have to write down what data you expect to collect/create during your project. After this, you will reflect on the back-up and storage for your data. We will provide you with a toolbox and a step-by-step guide to help you reflect on your data. You can download the PowerPoint template via a data repository:

-   Go to <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10731934>
-   Download the first file: 01_DFM_Template_Power_Point.pptx (ignore all other files!)
-   Follow the instructions on slide 2 (see step 4 below for additional information)
-   **Ignore any comments about Brightspace** - you'll have to follow step 5 outlined below to share your assignment using GitHub
-   **Only focus on slides 1-4** - the later slides are covered in [Assignment 3](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-RDM-101/11-Assignment-Data-Flow-Map-2.html)

### Step 4 - Reflect on the theme Back-up and Storage {-}

-   We talked about the [infrastructure that TU Delft offers for storing and backing up data](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-RDM-101/05-Essentials-for-Research-Data.html#research-data-infrastructure-at-tu-delft), so think:
    -   Where will you be storing the data?
    -   Where will the master copy be stored?
    -   What infrastructure will you use as a backup?
-   Keep in mind the flags you have added to the list of datasets when selecting the storage and backup for the data and code.
-   Reflect about the Theme "Back-up and storage", think about a strategy to securely store the data of your project and add your choice and considerations to the template.

### Step 5 - Share your assignment via your GitHub Issue {-}

To share your assignment you will need to either upload your assignment somewhere and provide a link, or use links you can set up via SURFdrive or OneDrive. 

-   **SURFdrive**: When the Desktop app is active, you can right-click files, select SURFdrive, and select 'create and copy a public link. See [Sharing using SURFdrive](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/data-sharing-SURFdrive/) for more details.

-   **OneDrive**: Right-click the file or folder in your OneDrive folder on your computer and select Share a OneDrive link. 
See [Sharing using OneDrive](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/data-sharing-Onedrive/index.html) for more details.
